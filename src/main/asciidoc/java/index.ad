= Apache Ignite Cluster Manager for Vert.x

This is a cluster manager implementation for Vert.x that uses http://ignite.apache.org/index.html[Apache Ignite].

In Vert.x a cluster manager is used for various functions including:

* Discovery and group membership of Vert.x nodes in a cluster
* Maintaining cluster wide topic subscriber lists (so we know which nodes are interested in which event bus
addresses)
* Distributed Map support
* Distributed Locks
*  Distributed Counters

Cluster managers *do not* handle the event bus inter-node transport, this is done directly by Vert.x with TCP
connections.

Vert.x cluster manager is a pluggable component, so you can pick the one you want, or the one that is the most
adapted to your environment. So you can replace default Vert.x cluster manager by this implementation.

== Using this cluster manager

If the jar is on your classpath then Vert.x will automatically detect this and use it as the cluster manager.
Please make sure you donâ€™t have any other cluster managers on your classpath or Vert.x might choose the wrong one.

Alternatively, you can configure the following system property to instruct vert.x to use this cluster manager:
`-Dvertx.clusterManagerFactory=io.vertx.spi.cluster.ignite.IgniteClusterManager`

### Using Vert.x from command line

`vertx-ignite-3.2.0.jar` should be in the `lib` directory of the Vert.x installation.

### Using Vert.x in Maven or Gradle project

Add a dependency to the artifact.

* Maven (in your `pom.xml`):

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
  <artifactId>vertx-ignite</artifactId>
  <version>3.2.0</version>
</dependency>
----

* Gradle (in your `build.gradle` file):

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
compile 'io.vertx:vertx-ignite:3.2.0'
----

### Programmatically specifying cluster manager

You can also specify the cluster manager programmatically. In order to do this just specify it on the options
when you are creating your Vert.x instance, for example:

[source,java]
----
ClusterManager clusterManager = new IgniteClusterManager();

VertxOptions options = new VertxOptions().setClusterManager(clusterManager);
Vertx.clusteredVertx(options, res -> {
  if (res.succeeded()) {
    Vertx vertx = res.result();
  } else {
    // failed!
  }
});
----

== Configuring cluster manager

=== Using configuration file

The cluster manager is configured by a file `default-ignite.xml` which is packaged inside the jar.

If you want to override this configuration you can provide `ignite.xml` file on your classpath and this will be
used instead.

The xml file is a Ignite configuration file and is described in details in
https://apacheignite.readme.io/docs[Apache Ignite documentation].

### Configuring programmatically

You can also specify configuration programmatically:

[source,java]
----
IgniteConfiguration cfg = new IgniteConfiguration();
// Configuration code (omitted)

ClusterManager clusterManager = new IgniteClusterManager(cfg);

VertxOptions options = new VertxOptions().setClusterManager(clusterManager);
Vertx.clusteredVertx(options, res -> {
  if (res.succeeded()) {
    Vertx vertx = res.result();
  } else {
    // failed!
  }
});
----

=== Discovery and network transport configuration

The default configuration uses `TcpDiscoveryMulticastIpFinder` so you must have multicast enabled on your network.
For cases when multicast is disabled `TcpDiscoveryVmIpFinder` should be used with pre-configured list of IP addresses.
Please see http://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/cluster-config[Cluster Configuration] section
at Apache Ignite documentation for details.

== Trouble shooting clustering

If the default multicast configuration is not working here are some common causes:

=== Multicast not enabled on the machine.

When using `UDP`, IP multicasting is required, on some systems, multicast route(s) need to be added to
the routing table otherwise, the default route will be used

Note that some systems don't consult the routing table for IP multicast routing, only for unicast routing

MacOS example:

----
# Adds a multicast route for 224.0.0.1-231.255.255.254
sudo route add -net 224.0.0.0/5 127.0.0.1

# Adds a multicast route for 232.0.0.1-239.255.255.254
sudo route add -net 232.0.0.0/5 192.168.1.3
